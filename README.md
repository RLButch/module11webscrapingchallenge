This Challenge was completed using a combination of class activity solutions, stackoverflow, datascience central and youtube tutorials. Along with askBSC and one on one tutorials
Section one, Mars News was successfully completed using Beautiful soup to scrape titles and preview text from the Mars website: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html.  A Beautiful soup object was created to parse the data and store the results which were printed within the notebook file (part_1_mars_news.ipynb). I decided to do the option of saving the scraped data into a file for ease of sharing - into a json file, but did not export this to a csv.
Section two, Scrape and analyse Mars Weather Data was completed successfully using beautiful soup and pandas dataframes for the analysis. 
There are 12 months in a martian year and in one martian year, 686 earth days pass. There are 1867 Martian days worth of data in thedataset, spreading from day 10 to day 1977 It is worth noting that in somedays data is taken multiple times. The coldest months are months 4 and 3 on -83 degrees and the warmest month is month 8 with -68 degrees. On average the atmospheric pressure is lowest in month 6 and highest in month 9.
This was a tricky yet satisfying challenge combinging website scraping and pandas skills gained in class.
